# bindgencr

Little program to generate crystal binding file for C libraries.

## Installation

Install CastXML : https://github.com/CastXML/CastXML

Clone this repository
crystal compile src/bindgencr.cr


## Usage

Not yet complete, but can still generate the binding for sqlite3.h ( without enumerations for now, see samples/sqlite3 ).

castxml --castxml-gccxml [HEADER] -o [OUTPUT XML FILE]
crystal run src/bindgencr.cr -- [OUTPUT XML FILE] -l[library name] -n [name to put after "lib" keyword]

It will print the result to stdout for now

See spec and samples folder to see what can be done for now.
